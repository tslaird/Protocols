# ODroid600 experiment protocol
date:
purpose:

1. Create overnight bacterial culture
bacterial strains grown:
date/time placed in the incubator:
temperature of the incubator:
additional notes:

2. Prepare test tubes with 5 mL of desired media. (Be sure to let the tubes warm in the incubator before inoculating the bacteria below).

3. Resuspend overnight culture in 1 mM Phosphate Buffer
pour contents of overnight culture into a conical tube (if not in one already)
centrifuge at 4,500 rpm for 10 min
remove supernatant
add 1 mL sterile 1 mM phosphate buffer
vortex to resuspend pellet
get OD of the sample and adjust to OD = ____

4. Inoculate the 5 mL of media with 16.67 uL (3.33 uL per mL media)  bacterial suspension and place the tubes in the respective holders in the ODroid600

Tube information:
Channel A:___________________________________________________     
Channel B:___________________________________________________
Channel C:___________________________________________________
Channel D:___________________________________________________
Incubator temp:	Incubator rpm:

5. Turn on the ODroid600 by plugging it into a power source. (Make sure the memory card is in the memory card slot)

6. Add antibiotics at specific time point if needed

7. Once the run on the ODroid600 is complete save the file following the steps below.
Insert the memory card into a slot on a computer/laptop
Rename the file from "LOG.TXT" to something more specific with a ".csv" extension. Record filename here:
Open the file in a text editor and insert comment lines at the top of the file to indicate the tubes in each channel. For example:
```
# A: P. putida 1290 in M9 plus 1 mM IAA
# B: P. putida 1290 in M9 plus 2 mM IAA
# C: P. putida 1290 in M9 plus 4 mM IAA
# D: P. putida 1290 in M9 plus 8 mM IAA
```
